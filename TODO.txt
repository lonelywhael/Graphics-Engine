1. XX learn framebuffers 
1.5. XX learn anti-aliasing
2. learn some optimizations (XX face culling, instancing, fustrum culling, deferred shading)
2.5 XX learn cube maps
3. XX learn shadows
3.5 XX fix material over-specification
3.6 XX learn post processing and fix pcf issues
3.7 XX fix the chaotic mess of how textures are handled and allow multiple shadows
3.75 attach fustrum values to light objects XX, and maybe figure out how to pass norm data to the shadow map shader?
3.76 XX implement for texture maps
3.8 cascade mapping
4. height maps and tesselation
5. clouds? (blending?)
6. text
7. menues
8. XX shader builder
    * XX streamline render functions
    * load and save
    * allow global variables (like n_lights) to be set by the CPU
9. model hierarchy
10. add some features to the scene class that manage the creation of render groups
    - adding automatic creation of render groups based on the models, lights, etc that have been added to the scene
11. memory stuff
    * smart pointers/reference counters
    * shallow/deep copying, copy on write
    * rule of 3/5
    
7. make a model builder
8. make a texture builder

6. solar system lighting simulation

7. neural nets
8. n body/gas collapse simulation
9. earth simulations
